`adafruit_boardtest.boardtest_voltage_monitor`
====================================================
Prints out the measured voltage on any onboard voltage/battery monitor pins.
Note that some boards have an onboard voltage divider to decrease the voltage
to these pins.

Run this script as its own main.py to individually run the test, or compile
with mpy-cross and call from separate test script.

* Author(s): Shawn Hymel for Adafruit Industries

Implementation Notes
--------------------

**Hardware:**

* `Multimeter <https://www.adafruit.com/product/2034>`_

**Software and Dependencies:**

* Adafruit CircuitPython firmware for the supported boards:
  https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases
