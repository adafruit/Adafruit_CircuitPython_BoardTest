`adafruit_boardtest.boardtest_sd_cd`
====================================================
Reports the output of an SD card's chip detect (CD) pin.

Run this script as its own main.py to individually run the test, or compile
with mpy-cross and call from separate test script.

* Author(s): Shawn Hymel for Adafruit Industries

Implementation Notes
--------------------

**Hardware:**

* `SD Card <https://www.adafruit.com/product/1294>`_

**Software and Dependencies:**

* Adafruit CircuitPython firmware for the supported boards:
