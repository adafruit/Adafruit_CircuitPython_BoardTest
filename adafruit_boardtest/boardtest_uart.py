`adafruit_boardtest.boardtest_uart`
====================================================
Performs random writes and reads across UART. Connect a wire from TX pin to RX pin.

Run this script as its own main.py to individually run the test, or compile
with mpy-cross and call from separate test script.

* Adafruit CircuitPython firmware for the supported boards:
