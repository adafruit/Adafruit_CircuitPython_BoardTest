`adafruit_boardtest.boardtest_sd`
====================================================
Performs random writes and reads to SD card over SPI.

Run this script as its own main.py to individually run the test, or compile
with mpy-cross and call from separate test script.

* Author(s): Shawn Hymel for Adafruit Industries
