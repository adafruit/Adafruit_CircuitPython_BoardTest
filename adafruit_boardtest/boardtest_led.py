`adafruit_boardtest.boardtest_led`
====================================================
Toggles all available onboard LEDs. You will need to manually verify their
operation by watching them.

Run this script as its own main.py to individually run the test, or compile
with mpy-cross and call from separate test script.

* Author(s): Shawn Hymel for Adafruit Industries

Implementation Notes
--------------------

**Software and Dependencies:**

* Adafruit CircuitPython firmware for the supported boards:
